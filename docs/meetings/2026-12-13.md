Highway 40 runs through the middle of town. Major highway and the main street. 

Pedestrian improvement, bulbouts. Some new stoplights on main street. Working with CDOT for design and approval. 

Curious... could we model what risk looks like now for pedestrian and what it'd look like now after this investment. 
- risk of pedestrian accidents

The rec center project was present a couple weeks ago. The overall cost is so high that there is no 

town has the data on pedestrian fatalities, we can get that sent over it just lives in a report. 

It'd be nice to have data that support policy. A backing of the WHY. 

Hew can get us in touch w/ the engineering firm called SGM. 

Steamboat springs may be facing similar issues. It also has highway 40 cutting right through town. 

Winter park is in the opposite direction

Both projects designed for this are both pedestrian based. 

All data is publicaly available. Free to use as we wish. 

Bulbouts, roundabouts potential ideas for improving safety on the main street. Main stoplight as well on a key intersection.
